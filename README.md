##Golpen Web UI

Working repo for the web server for Golem Codepen application. Right now it is mostly just html...stay tuned

to test run, clone the repo and:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```
(the 'serve' script will run nodemon so files changes trigger a restart of node and rebuilds styles/files etc)

open your browser and go to:
